        let expected = "The most powerful MacBook Pro ever is here. With the blazing-fast M1 Pro or M1 Max chip — the first Apple silicon designed for pros — you get groundbreaking performance and amazing battery life. Add to that a stunning Liquid Retina XDR display, the best camera and audio ever in a Mac notebook, and all the ports you need. The first notebook of its kind, this MacBook Pro is a beast.  Up to 3.7x faster CPU performance1 Up to 13x faster graphics performance2 Up to 11x faster machine learning3 Up to 21 hours battery life4 Up to 10-core CPU Up to 16-core GPU Up to 32GB of unified memory Up to 200GB/s memory bandwidth 10-core CPU Up to 32‑core GPU Up to 64GB of unified memory Up to 400GB/s memory bandwidth M1 Pro and M1 Max scale the amazing M1 architecture to new heights — and for the first time, they bring a system on a chip (SoC) architecture to a pro notebook. Both have more CPU cores, more GPU cores and more unified memory than M1. Along with a powerful Neural Engine for supercharged machine learning and upgraded media engines with ProRes support, M1 Pro and M1 Max allow pros to do things they never could before. M1 Pro takes the exceptional performance of the M1 architecture to a whole new level for pro users. Even the most ambitious projects are easily handled with up to 10 CPU cores, up to 16 GPU cores, a 16‑core Neural Engine, and dedicated encode and decode media engines that support H.264, HEVC and ProRes codecs. Up to 16‑core GPU Up to 32GB of unified memory Up to 200GB/s memory bandwidth Support for two external displays Up to 20 streams of 4K ProRes video playback5 M1 Max is the most powerful chip ever created for a pro notebook, with 10 CPU cores, up to 32 GPU cores and a 16-core Neural Engine. It delivers two times faster graphics processing and double the memory bandwidth of M1 Pro. And it has a dedicated media engine for decode and two for encode — with up to two times faster video encoding — and two ProRes accelerators for even higher multi-stream performance. Up to 32‑core GPU Up to 64GB of unified memory Up to 400GB/s memory bandwidth Support for four external displays Up to 7 streams of 8K ProRes video playback6 The new MacBook Pro is available in 14‑ and 16‑inch models. Each can be configured with the M1 Pro or M1 Max chip and offers unprecedent­ed levels of pro performance. So you can manipulate millions of polygons in Cinema 4D, edit up to seven streams of 8K ProRes video in Final Cut Pro, or grade colour in HDR on 8K 4444 ProRes video — all miles away from the edit bay. Ferocious performance with game‑changing battery life — that efficiency is the magic of Apple silicon. A single charge lets you compile up to four times as much code in Xcode19 or edit images for up to twice as long in Lightroom Classic.20 And unlike other notebooks, MacBook Pro delivers the same amazing performance whether it’s plugged in or not. The coolest part. Advanced thermal systems move 50 per cent more air, even at lower fan speeds. And thanks to the efficiency of Apple silicon, the fans never turn on for many tasks you do every day. Fast. And vast. Get jaw-dropping 7.4GB/s read speeds23 from the up to 8TB SSD — up to two times faster than the previous generation.24 So you can open 8K videos instantly or store hundreds of thousands of RAW photos at once. The new MacBook Pro is the first to put a system on a chip (SoC) into a pro notebook. Other pro systems use power-hungry CPUs, discrete GPUs and multiple chips, each working separately. M1 Pro and M1 Max combine the CPU, GPU, I/O and Neural Engine in a single SoC with unified memory. As a result, M1 Pro and M1 Max not only crush intensive workflows that were once impossible on a notebook — they also provide incredible battery life. Connected at the chip. Other pro notebooks need to copy data back and forth over a slower interface. Not the new MacBook Pro. Its CPU and GPU share a single pool of unified memory. That means every part of the chip connects to data and memory without needing to copy it, so everything you do is faster and more efficient. M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs each leverage up to eight high-performance cores and two high-efficiency cores to deliver faster processing at a tenth of the power. Their GPUs have access to lower-latency data with vastly improved power efficiency for unmatched performance per watt. At their peak, M1 Pro and M1 Max deliver 1.7 times more performance than the latest 8-core PC laptop chip in the same power envelope. And they match the highest performance levels of the PC chip at 70 per cent less power.25 M1 Pro consumes 70 per cent less power at its peak than a PC laptop with a discrete GPU.26 At its peak, M1 Max delivers more performance — and consumes 40 per cent less power — than a compact pro laptop with a high-performing discrete GPU. And compared with a high-end laptop with discrete graphics, M1 Max delivers similar performance while using 100 watts less power.26 Liquid Retina XDR. The best display ever in a notebook features Extreme Dynamic Range and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio. HDR content comes to life in photos, video and games — with refined specular highlights, incredible detail in shadows, and vibrant, true-to-life colours. Each display is factory calibrated and features pro reference modes for HDR colour grading, photography, design and print production. ProMotion. ProMotion comes to Mac for the first time, making everything from scrolling through a web page to gaming super-fluid and responsive — while also reducing power consumption. With refresh rates of up to 120Hz, the adaptive technology automatically adjusts to match the movement of the content. ProMotion video editors can also choose a fixed refresh rate that precisely aligns with their footage. Display enclosure. Less than 4mm thin, it provides the structure for the world’s best notebook display. Mini-LEDs. Thousands of mini-LEDs are grouped into individually controlled local dimming zones for precise brightness and contrast. Custom optical films and diffusers. Seven films and diffusers mix and shape the light efficiently while enabling an ultra-thin design. High mobility oxide TFT. The oxide thin film transistor (TFT) allows pixels to charge two times faster than before, enabling refresh rates of up to 120Hz. LCD panel. The active area of the display is pushed to the edge for up to 60 per cent thinner borders, providing more room for your content. 1,000nits sustained brightness 1,600nits peak brightness 10,000 mini-LEDs27 1,000,000:1contrast ratio 1,000,000,000 colours 16.2″ 3456x2234 7.7 million pixels 254 ppi 14.2″ 3024x1964 5.9 million pixels 254 ppi Staying connected is more important than ever. That’s why the new MacBook Pro camera has double the resolution — 1080p — and uses a lens with a wider aperture that lets in more light. Together with a larger image sensor that has more efficient pixels, the camera delivers two times better low‑light performance. Three studio‑quality mics. Thanks to mics with an up to 60 per cent lower noise floor, MacBook Pro can capture even the subtlest sounds. And the three-mic array uses directional beamforming so your voice always comes through loud and clear. Six-speaker sound system. Four force-cancelling woofers reveal notes up to a half-octave deeper and fill the room with up to 80 per cent more bass. And the high‑performance tweeters project clearer, fuller vocals. Spatial audio. Thanks to the room‑filling six‑speaker system and advanced algorithms, MacBook Pro supports spatial audio when playing music or video with Dolby Atmos, creating a sophisticated three‑dimensional soundstage. Combine that with the Liquid Retina XDR display, and it’s like having a portable cinema. Transfer photos and videos with an SDXC card reader. Connect to TVs or displays with HDMI output. Listen using a 3.5mm headphone jack that detects and automatically adjusts for high‑impedance headphones. Connect to high-speed peripherals or displays with three Thunderbolt 4 ports. And fast‑charge using the quick‑releasing MagSafe 3 port. For the first time, Magic Keyboard brings a full‑height function key row to MacBook Pro — with the tactile feel of mechanical keys that pros love. It includes new keyboard shortcuts for Spotlight, Dictation and Do Not Disturb. And Touch ID has a new, tactile ring that guides your finger for a fast, easy, secure way to unlock your Mac. Use a single keyboard and mouse or trackpad to work seamlessly between your Mac and iPad with Universal Control.28 Automate complex tasks with Shortcuts.
